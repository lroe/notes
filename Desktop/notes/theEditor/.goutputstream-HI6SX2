The first phase of building the compiler was to enter the raw model.

Usually, when we read files using read() from stdlib, we have to wait till enter key is pressed and then only we read the character one by one. This is called canonicalmode/cooked mode
We need to goto raw mode, to process each character one by one.

We did this by using the termos.h library and modifying some input control variables.

first we made 'press q'' to exit feature since, we need a way to exit the terminal.
then we disabled the echo feature
then we use axit(disableRawMode) to make sure the raw mode is disabled during exit
next we turn off canonical mode by disabling the ICANON flag. now we program will quit as soon as you press q

now we disabled some functionalities of keys like ctrl+c, ctrl+s, etc.. by disabling the corresponding flags.

now we turned off output processing. The terminal automatically converts \n to \r\n. we turn of thiss feature by turining off the OPOST flag

now we put a timeout for read() so as to do animate something on the screen while waiting for user input.

we added die function() to put some error handinling. perror() prints the string given to it , along with the line that caused the error , along with a description fo the error.
